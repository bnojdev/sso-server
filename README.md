# sso-server
This project is a Single Sign-On (SSO) web application built with Spring Boot. It demonstrates secure user registration, login, OTP-based account activation, and automatic cleanup of inactive accounts. Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt. The application uses H2 as the database and Thymeleaf for the frontend.
